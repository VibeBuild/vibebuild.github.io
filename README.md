# VibeBuild

**A simple build tool for programming languages.**  

It came from my need to compile small pieces of code quickly and in a practical way, without setting up things like Makefiles.  

From that, combined with a school research project about *vibe coding*, **VibeBuild** was born.  

---

## ✨ Features
- 🛠️ Fast compilation for small code snippets.
- 🚀 Supports multiple languages.
- 📜 Detailed log generation.
- 🔥 Run after build (`--run` or `-r`).
- 🏗️ Choose compiler (`--clang`).
- 📁 Set output directory (`-d`).

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rlois4/vibebuild.git
cd vibebuild
```

2. Make the installer executable:
```bash
chmod +x installer
```

3. Run it to install:
```bash
./installer
```

4. Run the program:
```bash

```
